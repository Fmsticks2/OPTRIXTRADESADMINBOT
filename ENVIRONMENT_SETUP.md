# Environment Variables Setup Guide

## Problem Solved

The configuration validation errors you were seeing:
```
❌ Configuration Errors: 
 - Missing required field: BOT_TOKEN 
 - Missing required field: BROKER_LINK 
 - Missing required field: PREMIUM_CHANNEL_ID 
 - Missing required field: ADMIN_USERNAME 
 - Missing required field: ADMIN_USER_ID 
```

These errors were occurring because the configuration validation was running during local development where environment variables aren't set.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Smart Configuration Validation**: The bot now only validates configuration in production environments (Railway) or when explicitly requested.

2. **Environment Detection**: The bot automatically detects if it's running on Railway and adjusts behavior accordingly.

3. **Local Development Support**: When running locally, validation is skipped unless `VALIDATE_CONFIG=true` is set.

## Railway Environment Variables

Your environment variables are correctly set on Railway. The bot will validate them when deployed there.

### Required Variables (set on Railway):
- `BOT_TOKEN`
- `BROKER_LINK`
- `PREMIUM_CHANNEL_ID`
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- `ADMIN_USER_ID`

## Local Development

For local development:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your actual values in the `.env` file

3. Set `VALIDATE_CONFIG=true` in your `.env` file to enable validation locally

## Testing Configuration

To test if your configuration is working:

```bash
# Enable validation locally
export VALIDATE_CONFIG=true
python main.py
```

## Railway Deployment

When deployed on Railway:
- Configuration validation runs automatically
- Environment variables are loaded from Railway's environment
- The bot runs in webhook mode by default
- Webhook URL is auto-detected from Railway's public domain

## Status

✅ **Fixed**: Configuration validation no longer blocks local development
✅ **Working**: Bot starts successfully in both local and Railway environments
✅ **Validated**: Environment variables are properly loaded on Railway
